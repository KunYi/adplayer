1 Overview
----------

The AVR32® DSP Library is a compilation of digital signal processing functions. All 
function availables in the DSP Library, from the AVR UC3 Software Framework. 

All the source code (C code and assembly optimized), software example and GCC 
and IAR® projects are released in the AVR UC3 Software Framework.

This section describes the changes between the 1.4.2 and the 1.4.3 releases.


4.2 Notable Bug Fixes, improvements and new features
    + SERVICES\DSPLIB\GENERIC\ADVANCED\RESAMPLING\dsp16_resampling.c
      ++ Added dsp16_resampling_link - This API is used to link a stream
         previously re-sampled buffer with a new re-sampling structure. This is
	 used to keep the continuity of two buffers re-sampled using two
	 different re-sampling parameters.
    + SERVICES\DSPLIB\GENERIC\BASIC\VECTORS\vect_dsp32_complex_abs.c
      ++ Change the data type used for internal calculations from S32 to S64.
         This lead to overflowing values and therefore to a wrong result.
    + SERVICES\DSPLIB\
      ++ Added more documentation on the preconditions required before using
         the FFT functions.
