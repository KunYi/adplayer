<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The INTC collects interrupt requests from the peripherals, prioritizes them, and delivers an interrupt
request and an autovector to the CPU. The AVR32 architecture supports 4 priority levels for
regular, maskable interrupts, and a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI).</p><br>
<p>The INTC supports up to 64 groups of interrupts. Each group can have up to 32 interrupt request
lines, these lines are connected to the peripherals. Each group has an Interrupt Priority Register
(IPR) and an Interrupt Request Register (IRR). The IPRs are used to assign a priority level and
an autovector to each group, and the IRRs are used to identify the active interrupt request within
each group. If a group has only one interrupt request line, an active interrupt group uniquely
identifies the active interrupt request line, and the corresponding IRR is not needed. The INTC
also provides one Interrupt Cause Register (ICR) per priority level. These registers identify the
group that has a pending interrupt of the corresponding priority level. If several groups have a
pending interrupt of the same level, the group with the lowest number takes priority.</p>

<h2>INTC Software Driver</h2>

    <p>This driver provides an API to get access to the main features of the INTC controller.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The driver is composed of :
     <li><a href="intc.c">intc.c</a> </li>
     <li><a href="intc.h">intc.h</a> (for accurate API description, read this header file).</li>
     <li><a href="exception.S">exception.S</a> (for Exception and interrupt vectors handeling).</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>INTC Software Driver Examples</h2>
    <p>One examples are currently available:
       <li><a href="./EXAMPLE/readme.html">Use the INTC driver for the USART RXRDY interrupt.</a></li>
